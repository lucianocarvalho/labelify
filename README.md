# Labelify

Labelify is a lightweight, Prometheus-compatible proxy that enhances your PromQL query results using dynamic, rule-based label enrichment, enabling more insightful dashboards, smarter alerts, and clearer operational context - without modifying your original metrics or creating ingestion configs.

## üí° What does Labelify do?

Let's suppose you have a series of replicas running on your cluster:

```
$ sum(kube_deployment_spec_replicas) by (deployment)

{deployment="microservice-1"}                             1
{deployment="microservice-2"}                             1
{deployment="microservice-3"}                             1
{deployment="prometheus-grafana"}                         1
{deployment="prometheus-kube-prometheus-operator"}        1
{deployment="coredns"}                                    1
```

And you intend to write Labelify rules to group deployments by team:

```yml
sources:
  - name: static_map
    type: yaml
    mappings:
      # Using exact match for coredns
      coredns:
        labels:
          team: networking
          business_unit: platform

      # Using wildcard to match all prometheus deployments
      prometheus-.*:
        labels:
          team: observability
          business_unit: platform

enrichment:
  rules:
    - match:
        metric: "kube_deployment_spec_replicas"
        label: "deployment"
      enrich_from: static_map
      add_labels:
        - team
        - business_unit
      fallback:
        team: "unknown"
        business_unit: "n/a"
```

Enriched response from Labelify:

```
{team="observability", business_unit="platform"}        2
{team="networking", business_unit="platform"}           1
{team="unknown", business_unit="n/a"}                   3
```

Now your dashboards and alerts can group deployments by responsible team, without needing to change how metrics are collected or creating label replace rules.

If no rule matches the executed query, seamlessly falls back to acting as a transparent Prometheus-agnostic proxy - forwarding any query without interfering in your results.

We currently support both [instant vectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-vectors) and [range vectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-vectors).

## ‚ú® Features

**What Labelify can do (and what‚Äôs coming soon):**

- Create new labels into your query results
- Aggregate results dynamically based in your current labels
- Creating conditions using expressions and templates (coming soon)

**Supported data for rules:**

- Static mappings (defined in config.yaml)
- External APIs (coming soon)
- Other prometheus queries (coming soon)

# üöÄ Installation

There are various ways of installing Labelify.

### Using Docker

You can quickly get started using Docker:

```bash
# Run the container as a proxy
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./examples/config.yaml:/etc/labelify/config.yaml \
  lucianoajunior/labelify:main
```
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** You need to create your own config.yaml with the enrichment rules and label mappings. The default configuration in this example is just proxying queries to http://prometheus:9090/.

### Using Kubernetes

Simply run:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucianocarvalho/labelify/main/k8s/manifest.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

You should see output like this:
```  
namespace/labelify created
configmap/labelify-config created
deployment.apps/labelify created
service/labelify created
```

Feel free to browse the resources:

```bash
kubectl get all -n labelify
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Don't forget to configure your prometheus url inside the `configmap/labelify-config`. The default configuration in this example is just proxying queries to http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local:9090/.

After configuring it correctly you can test it by running a command like this:

```bash
# Port-forwarding
kubectl port-forward service/labelify -n labelify 8080:80

# Testing the proxy
curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/query?query=time()
```
